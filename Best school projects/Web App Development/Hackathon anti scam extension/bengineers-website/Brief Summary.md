<h1> BenjiShield: Brief Summary </h1>
BenjiShield is designed to tackle key challenges in today's digital landscape, including the overwhelming volume of information, the spread of misinformation, psychological manipulation, and the lack of robust community support. Targeted at websites that reference content through URLs, such as news outlets and social media platforms, BenjiShield provides a practical solution for fostering digital integrity.

At its core, BenjiShield empowers communities through two key features: Community Notes and User-Based Tagging.

- Community Notes: Users can contribute corrections, additional context, or diverse perspectives to posts and news articles, enriching the content and promoting transparency.
- User-Based Tagging: By aggregating user sentiments and tags, BenjiShield reflects the collective voice of the community on posts, ensuring that users' perspectives are acknowledged and shared with others.

A unique value proposition of the tool is its ability to categorize and evaluate posts through topic tags and three core metadata categories:

- Sources: Captures the nature and origin of the information to assess its credibility.
- Reliability: Reflects the trustworthiness of the content based on user feedback and algorithm verification.
- Relevance: Indicates the timeliness and applicability of information through timestamps.

Tags would be generated algorithmically, whilst enabling users to chime in and add to the tags they feel are relevant via User-Based Tagging.

Together, these features enable users to better navigate the digital world by identifying credible information, avoiding manipulation, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility for online safety.

Because defending Singapore's digital safety is a team sport, BenjiShield brings Singaporeans together to build a more informed and resilient online ecosystem.
